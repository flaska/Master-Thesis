The aim of this Diploma Thesis is the development of a C++ application used for viewing Magnetic Resonance data. The task was given by IKEM institute\footnote{Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine \cite{ikem}} and was started in work \cite{neskudla} and followed in works \cite{flaska_bc} and \cite{flaska_vu}. The application (further called ``Dicom-Presenter'') allows a user to open MRI images and offers some unique displaying features required by IKEM.

This Diploma Thesis sets three goals to be achieved: handle project compilation, rewrite application rendering engine and the implementation of some new features. The project compilation process needed to be reviewed and automated. There were dependencies on five external libraries which complicated project deployment. Therefore, the rendering part of the application had to be rewritten to remove project dependency on 3rd party libraries like OpenGL\citesec{openglhome}, Cg toolkit\citesec{cgtoolkit}, plib\citesec{plibhome}. Lastly, multi-planar reconstruction\footnote{A multi-planar reconstruction is a way for displaying three-dimensional images. Three discrete slices in three perpendicular planes are displayed. See Chapter \ref{multiplanar}.} and image segmentation were added into the application.
