Dicom-Presenter is an application for viewing image data. Entire image manipulation was solved with use of OpenGL library in early version of Dicom-Presenter. Because OpenGL was expected to be removed from Dicom-Presenter there was a need to reimplement all classes handling image manipulation. Images must be loaded from a file, stored in memory and drew on a screen. According to user need Dicom-Presenter must be able to change image's contrast and brightness.

One of important tasks to reimplement in Dicom-Presenter was an ability to change image brightness and contrast. Images which will be opened in Dicom-Presenter can be captured on various MRI units with various imaging properties. The ability to increase image brightness and contrast is mandatory to ensure sufficient display quality. Too dark or too gray images need to be brightened or need to increase contrast to allow obesrvation of smaller physiological findings.
